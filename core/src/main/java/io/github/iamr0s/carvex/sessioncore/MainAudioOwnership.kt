/** Who owns the CarPlay main audio stream, as far as this session can tell.
 *
 * The receiver may take main audio for itself (its own prompt, its own media) and says so through the
 * changeModes/audioOwner resource handshake. Until ownership is actually settled the state stays
 * UNKNOWN and main output is withheld: sending main audio while the car also owns the stream produces
 * two overlapping main streams, which is heard as doubled, level-jumping audio while the log
 * afterwards shows nothing unusual.
 *
 * UNKNOWN is never left by waiting. It ends when one of these is true:
 *  - the receiver advertises no type-100 main audio stream at all (OURS), or
 *  - we announced our own hold over the control session and it was accepted (OURS), or
 *  - the receiver declared ownership in changeModes (OURS/THEIRS).
 *
 * [log] is the session log. [announceHold] performs the modesChanged round trip and reports whether
 * it was accepted; it may throw, because an unreachable control session is not an ownership decision.
